# Traffic-Sign-Recognition via CNN 

This project involves three CNN architectures to solve a problem of traffic sign recongnition.

## Getting Started

The instructions below will give you a guideline on how to uses the code for your development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Run the code on a Python3-based platform, such as Colab, Jupyter Notebook and Pycharm.

The required packages are listed as follows:

```
Python3 built-in modules: os, glob, random, time
tensorflow - Version 2.2.0
numpy
pandas
matplotlib.pyplot
skimage
PIL
sklearn
```
